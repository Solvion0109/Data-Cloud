Overview
---------
When designing prompts in Prompt Builder or assigning skills in Skills Builder, it is crucial to ensure that Einstein has access to all necessary data. 
This may involve multiple related data layers or data from various integrated sources.


What Are Data Graphs?
*********************
Data Graph is Precomputed denormalised graph of DMOs/CIs derived  from related lakehouse tables , maintained  in near real time and queryable  for fast retrieval.
Data Graphs in Data Cloud allow you to visualize and manage relationships between Data Model Objects (DMOs), similar to Schema Builder. 
They enable:
1. Tracing related fields.
2. Rearranging relationships using drag-and-drop.
3. Ensuring the correct field data is included in an AI application.

How Data Graphs Work?
********************
Building a Data Graph:

1. Start with a Primary DMO{only one}.
2. Select objects and fields to include.
3. Optionally add related objects(Max 9 related object we add), Data Cloud Segments, and Data Cloud Insights.


Data Processing & Transformation:
********************************

Selected components are processed into a flattened, read-only data graph record.
Used for decision-making, filtering, and personalization.

DMO Categories:
**************

A Primary DMO can belong to any category except Engagement (Profile is the most common).
Related DMOs can belong to Profile, Other, or Engagement categories.


Final Data Graph Record:


Transforms hierarchical relationships into a flattened, read-only record.


Contains metadata (e.g., data space, data graph names).


Stores primary DMO and related object data as a queryable JSON blob.
